           <p>
                The Waterfall Model was first Process Model to be introduced. It is also referred 
                to as a linear-sequential life cycle model. It is very simple to understand and use.
                In a waterfall model, each phase must be completed before the next phase can begin and 
                there is no overlapping in the phases.
            </p>
            <p>
                Waterfall model is the earliest SDLC approach that was used for software development .
            </p>
            <p>
                The waterfall Model illustrates the software development process in a linear sequential
                flow; hence it is also referred to as a linear-sequential life cycle model. This means 
                that any phase in the development process begins only if the previous phase is complete.
                In waterfall model phases do not overlap.
