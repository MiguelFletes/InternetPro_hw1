            <p>
                The spiral model combines the idea of iterative development with the systematic, 
                controlled aspects of the waterfall model. Spiral model is a combination of iterative 
                development process model and sequential linear development model i.e. waterfall model 
                with very high emphasis on risk analysis. It allows for incremental releases of the 
                product, or incremental refinement through each iteration around the spiral.

            </p>
            <p>
                The spiral model has four phases. A software project repeatedly passes through these 
                phases in iterations called Spirals.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Identification:</b>This phase starts with gathering the business requirements in 
                the baseline spiral. In the subsequent spirals as the product matures, identification of
                system requirements, subsystem requirements and unit requirements are all done in this 
                phase.

                This also includes understanding the system requirements by continuous communication 
                between the customer and the system analyst. At the end of the spiral the product is 
                deployed in the identified market.
                </li>
                <li><b>Design:</b>Design phase starts with the conceptual design in the baseline spiral and
                involves architectural design, logical design of modules, physical product design and 
                final design in the subsequent spirals.
                </li>
                <li><b>Construct or Build:</b>Construct phase refers to production of the actual software 
                product at every spiral. In the baseline spiral when the product is just thought of
                and the design is being developed a POC (Proof of Concept) is developed in this phase 
                to get customer feedback.

                Then in the subsequent spirals with higher clarity on requirements and design details a 
                working model of the software called build is produced with a version number. These 
                builds are sent to customer for feedback.
                </li>
                <li><b>Evaluation and Risk Analysis:</b>Risk Analysis includes identifying, estimating, 
                and monitoring technical feasibility and management risks, such as schedule slippage 
                and cost overrun. After testing the build, at the end of first iteration, the customer
                evaluates the software and provides feedback.
